Chrome extension to keep alarm.com cameras active.

## Issue
Currently when accessing cameras through alarm.com, there is no way to view them locally on your network short of some drastic steps dealing with flashing the firmware. This issue has been brought up many times. As such, if you want to have a stream of your cameras on Chrome, they have timeouts that cause you to constantly have to refresh. This chrome extension keeps the cameras active so you can continually view them. Great for work from home that wants a monitor on for their cameras. 


## Instructions
* Go to `chrome://extensions`
* Make sure Developer mode is on 
* Click <b>Load unpacked</b>
* Select directory
* Refresh alarm.com page


## Todo
* Add icon
* Update manifest version
